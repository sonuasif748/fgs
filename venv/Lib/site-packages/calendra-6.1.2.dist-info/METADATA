Overview
========

Calendra is a Python module that offers classes able to handle calendars,
list legal / religious holidays and gives working-day-related computation
functions.

History
=======

Calendra is a fork of `Workalendar <https://github.com/peopledoc/workalendar>`_
designed to be more extensible and introspectable, adding interfaces where
`Workalendar is philosophically opposed for the sake of simplicity
<https://github.com/peopledoc/workalendar/pull/79>`_.

What can Calendra do that Workalendar cannot?

- Provides descriptions for holidays for the "day indicated" for each
  Holiday (such as '3rd Monday in August').
- Keeps distinct the indicated and observed dates for Holidays, such
  that it's possible to determine on what day a given holiday is observed.
- Allows the number of Holidays in a calendar year to be counted.
- Consolidates observance logic in the core code rather than requiring
  each calendar implementation to implement its own.

Status
======

The project is stable and in production use. Calendra follows the principles
of `semver <https://semver.org>`_ for released verisons.

If you spot any bug or wish to add a calendar, please refer to the `Contributing doc <CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_.

Usage sample
============

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from datetime import date
    >>> from calendra.europe import France
    >>> cal = France()
    >>> cal.holidays(2012)
    [(datetime.date(2012, 1, 1), 'New year'),
     (datetime.date(2012, 4, 9), 'Easter Monday'),
     (datetime.date(2012, 5, 1), 'Labour Day'),
     (datetime.date(2012, 5, 8), 'Victory in Europe Day'),
     (datetime.date(2012, 5, 17), 'Ascension Day'),
     (datetime.date(2012, 5, 28), 'Whit Monday'),
     (datetime.date(2012, 7, 14), 'Bastille Day'),
     (datetime.date(2012, 8, 15), 'Assumption of Mary to Heaven'),
     (datetime.date(2012, 11, 1), "All Saints' Day"),
     (datetime.date(2012, 11, 11), 'Armistice Day'),
     (datetime.date(2012, 12, 25), 'Christmas')]
    >>> cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 25))  # it's Christmas
    False
    >>> cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 30))  # it's Sunday
    False
    >>> cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 26))
    True
    >>> cal.add_working_days(date(2012, 12, 23), 5)  # 5 working days after Xmas
    datetime.date(2012, 12, 31)

For a more complete documentation and advanced usage, go to
`the official workalendar documentation <https://peopledoc.github.io/workalendar>`_.

External dependencies
=====================

Calendra has been tested on the Python versions declared in setup.cfg.

If you're using wheels, you should be fine without having to install extra system packages. As of ``v7.0.0``, we have dropped ``ephem`` as a dependency for computing astronomical ephemeris in favor of ``skyfield``. So if you had any trouble because of this new dependency, during the installation or at runtime, `do not hesitate to file an issue <https://github.com/peopledoc/workalendar/issues/>`_.

Tests
=====

Travis status:

Caveats
=======

Please take note that some calendars are not 100% accurate. The most common
example is the Islamic calendar, where some computed holidays are not exactly on
the same official day decided by religious authorities, and this may vary
country by country. Whenever it's possible, try to adjust your results with
the official data provided by the adequate authorities.
